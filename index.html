    Mostly a place for me to think outloud. Ideas here are mostly a mix and match of various sources with a few of my ideas mixed in.

    <ul> 
        <li><a href="math_essays/not_all_k-forms_are_decomposable.pdf" target="_blank">
             Showing not every k-form is decomposable using the Grassmannian
             </a>
        <br>
        Indeed all k-forms are decomposable iff k is 1, n-1 or n iff the Plucker embedding of the Grassmanian into a projective space is surjective.
        I explain the details in the pdf.

            Monoid actions unifying constructions in Algebra
        </a>
        <br>
        A brief note showing how monoid actions may be used to define most of the "invariance" concepts in elementary Algebra.
        As examples we have subgroups, normal subgroups, ideals and submodules. This note is inspired by Bourbaki's treatment of actions
        but I made quite a few adjustments.
